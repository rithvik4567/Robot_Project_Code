Welcome to Team H5â€™s Robot Project Website!

Throughout the spring 2020 semester, we worked together to design, build, and code an autonomous robot to navigate a course designed to simulate basic tasks a worker in a diner might complete throughout a workday. The goal was to create a robot that could complete these basic tasks, allowing the staff to focus on customer interaction and more complicated operations.
