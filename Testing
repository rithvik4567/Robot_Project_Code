Testing – Exploration Activities
Throughout this course, a number of “exploration activities” were performed by the faculty. These gave the teams a chance to interact with and learn about 
different aspects of the robot available to us including shaft encoding, light detection, line-following, and RPS navigation (robot positioning system).

The first exploration was centered around the CdS cell and microswitches used to detect walls. based on our results from this, we determined that a
yellow filter over the CdS cell would be best for differentiating the color of the jukebox light. We decided to implement this in our robot’s design. 
While the microswitches were useful, we decided they would be best as a secondary method of navigation and decided not to use them on our robot initially, 
but to make it possible to add them if needed.

The second performance test was centered around line following and shaft encoding. The shaft encoding proved to be very useful, and after seeing how it 
worked, we decided to use igwan motors and the built-in shaft encoding on our robot as a main method of navigation. Line following initially seemed useful,
however, we soon realized that much of the course could be completed without it, and in fact sometimes more efficiently.

The third test was centered around RPS and Data logging. The RPS system allowed the robot to locate itself on the course and self-correct. We planned from 
the beginning to use this, and this exploration confirmed its usefulness. Data logging out tests seemed like it could be helpful if there were situations
where we were unable to visually tell what tweaks needed to be made, however, this was never needed.
